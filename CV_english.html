My name is Pan, Arsen Pan. 
I was born in USSR (1975). My mother was very busied (as a medicine worker in KZ), so grandparens took me into Crimea at 2 years old.
Grandfather was a teacher of mathematics, which provided me with good marks and allowed me to finish the school at rate of 2 years sooner
as a standard pupil does usually. At vilage conditions I haven't had any competitor in mathematics, moreover, I managed to get the first
"skills" in programming (by assist of a portative programming device, a soviet analog of the western microcomputers like "Texas Instruments", etc.),
when my camerades haven't heard the word "computer" even! 
My "adult" education found its realization at the Simferopol state university (applience mathematic),
but due to poority of the 90th years
on X-soviet space after graduation I had to work some years in the depressive vilage atmosphere. 1998 I became very angry with it, took all my documents and came
to my university again. I let call me as a young man, which just finished the school (I have had a toll appearance), and came through exams
(into not the same branch, into the "classical" mathematic). Many techers recalled me, but recognized results of exams with laugh.
Of course, I not began study again. This time there was coming to burn a new faculty, economical, and the teachers got rid of me by inviting me
to be a science helper at the new faculty. Parallely I teached students to the programming and the high mathematics.
It was more funny as teaching in a village school, of course.
By the time, I growed more solid and asked to allow me into the full scientifical life. The "gates" to it is such graduation, as the aspiranture.
This a kind of "super high" school pays some stipendium and it gaves some plan to develope one into a member of the scientifical world.
They answered, that "a human being can live without it". There came the understanding of miserability of carier there.
I came to professor of mathematics, that teached me 7 years ago, and he gave me a problem, linked with some "limitants", developed by
some matematican Koyalovich at beginning of the 20th century. I solved it, and the professor took me to aspiranture by the mathematical
faculty. The first years were very successful. I found a proof of some theorem, more linked with them setted onto me.
It was about some equation (a static border problem in theory of elasticity), and it allowed more accuracy solutions.
But after 3 standard years of aspiranture they organized nothing. I heard not definite explanations, that I am "not ready", that
"there is need to adopt my theoretical results to the them" and so on. They promised 2-3 years and the future would "belong to me" at last.
But unfortunately there found start a queue of deaths, including grandparents of mine, including some scientifical patrons and others.
2014 there began the well known conflict between UA and RU. I have to coscentrate in in the saving of my place in department
(I have a good work-place at that time, although my Ph.-grade was placed into a undefinited hanging state). I worked a year or more and
proved to leave university by throwing myself into IT-technologies. It was a mistake. I became a little Java-programist in some company,
but my duty was to "fix the bugs". It took my thinking abilities a bit, but it was not very creative (neither a science, nor an art).
I leaved it after year. I came into a private "offshore" company, where I take a time among youth, we created some animation for "banners" (advertisement).
I successed in seldom moments of free time to understand principles of neural networks. I wrote a network, which proved to rebuild the sinusoide.
I wrote in in language JS, and this toy can be considered as a good example to help to understand what the neural networks are...
The leader have had a impulsive nature, which was very opposite vs. mine. Great collective drinkings ("corporatives") and great conflicts - it is the characterical
features of my times at this company. I not reached promoution, the leader handed me a sum of money and I leaved the sity to dive into downshifting at the
village, where was abandoned the house of grandparents. I enjoyed me with tuning of car (an old "VW Golf"-like vehicle), with building of bicicles (I have build an electric motocycle even) and so on.

One day I have a little dangerous trip to Cherson-region of UA to make the UA-passport (just for fun).
This voyage is described <a href="https://www.drive2.ru/l/568978026994335798/">here</a> (in Russian).
</p>
As it is visible for you, not any serious scientifical intelligencies were provided by me since leaving of university. All my "investigations" are linked with "surviving",
and seldom programming exercises, which are provided by me sometimes despite of lack of IT-work, are linked with the "smart-house" technologies,
it caused by need of supplement of the village house (I feel myself like I. Musk on a exterrial planet).
